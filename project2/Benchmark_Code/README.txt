The benchmark code are stored in 7 different folders, 6 of those correspond to
the six categories of LLVM transformation passes that are discussed in the report.
And the one folder named “all” is the combined study of a sequence of passes.

To run the benchmark, you only need to type
./runTest.sh

and it automatically makes the project and runs the Benchmark Test

Please use these code on UNIX system only because the code in UNIX-specific.

Thank you!
